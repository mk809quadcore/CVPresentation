**Background**

  I have more than 20 years of experience in Security and Information Technology. This experience encompasses security product specialties, consultancy, enterprise security architecture and strategies. This combination, together with experience with security vendors, large enterprises, and government sectors, can drive positive project and strategic outcomes. 

  This experience was across Singapore and Australia, in addition to managing resources in India. I supported Data Center, Private and Public Cloud Reference Architectures as a Security Architect in ANZ Bank. Within that function, it comes with the responsibility of validating security designs and influencing strategic decisions. I have then leveraged his extensive background to assist large Victorian energy retailers and leading financial institutions with improvements such as certifications, consultations, designing security patterns, security enterprise and solution architectures, along with assessing these organisations against industry frameworks. 
  
 My consultation ultimately influenced the strategic security direction of these organisations and helped shape the road maps to uplift their organisational security posture and reduce their risk exposures.
